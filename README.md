# Arphros Framework
A music game framework using a level-based system, not charting or whatever you guys called it.

## What is this?

This is a base version of Arphros, this repository acts as a placeholder for all the prototyping and stuff. You can see the progress as the development progresses as well, this project is different from any of the previous Arphros as the code is remade (again, for the 4th time) from scratch.

You won't see much even if you cloned it, we'll be building this out when we have a solid idea of what the revamp will be. But as for now, thank you for visiting the repository!

## Current plan

We plan on adding a few modes for the new Arphros, the legacy mode basically being "Dancing Line" will no longer be our main focus. Adding a new twist to it so that we can at least make this sustainable or profitable for ourselves (We haven't gotten any money or donation yet from this game that could sufficiently back up the cost of the maintenance of the game).

[Contact us (Discord)](https://arphros.kjn.in.th/discord) if you have any suggestion, feedback, or additional ideas that you think might be cool to include in this new version!

### ðŸ”“ License Change

The project will become open-source under the following conditions:

- **If Arphros development is inactive for 2 consecutive years**, **or**
- **If total lifetime revenue exceeds $1000 USD** and the project continues to receive active support for at least 6 months thereafter

When this happens, the code will be **relicensed**:

- However, the original developer [**Rhitomaic**](https://github.com/ReDarkTechnology) reserves the right to relicense it under either the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) instead, based on what best serves the project and its contributors at that time.

All changes will apply retroactively to the codebase and will be announced publicly.

---

We aim to make Arphros fully open-source once the project is sustainable and stable for long-term community development.

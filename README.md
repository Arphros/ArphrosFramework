# Arphros Framework
A music game framework using a level-based system, not charting or whatever you guys called it.

## What is this?

This is a base version of Arphros, this repository acts as a placeholder for all the prototyping and stuff. You can see the progress as the development progresses as well, this project is different from any of the previous Arphros as the code is remade (again, for the 4th time) from scratch.

You won't see much even if you cloned it, we'll be building this out when we have a solid idea of what the revamp will be. But as for now, thank you for visiting the repository!

## Current plan

We plan on adding a few modes for the new Arphros, the legacy mode basically being "Dancing Line" will no longer be our main focus. Adding a new twist to it so that we can at least make this sustainable or profitable for ourselves (We haven't gotten any money or donation yet from this game that could sufficiently back up the cost of the maintenance of the game).

[Contact us (Discord)](https://arphros.kjn.in.th/discord) if you have any suggestion, feedback, or additional ideas that you think might be cool to include in this new version!

## Requirements

- Unity 6000.2.6f2 (Supported)
- C# IDE/Code Editor (Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code + C# Extension/JetBrains Rider)

## License

This project is **source-available**, not open-source.

IN REVISION

We aim to make Arphros fully open-source once the project is sustainable and stable for long-term community development.
